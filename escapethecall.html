			<p>A browser-based game designed to entertain the player and demonstrate Javascript capabilities. Includes a retro 90s design of completely hand-rolled CSS.</p>
			<p>Technologies used: Javascript, HTML, CSS, jQuery, Underscore.js, Node.js, Express.js, AJAX, JSON, Photoshop, GIMP.</p>

			<h2>Example User Stories:</h2>
			<p>These breakdown tasks to make it easier to focus on individual aspects of an app. Separated into "Current" (what I knew I could finish), "Backlog" (what I hoped to get to), and "Icebox" (which I would have to work on after the project ended). These are a few of the stories I created.</p>
			<h3>Current</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>As a user, when I hit start, the game starts.</li>
				<li>As a user, when I choose an answer, points are affected.</li>
				<li>As a user, when I am near losing, there are warnings I can see.</li>
				<li>As a user, when I lose the game, I can start a new game.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Backlog</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>As a user, when the mother asks a question, I am rewarded for choosing an answer.</li>
				<li>As a user, when I get a high score, I can put in my initials.</li>
				<li>As a user, when I try to get off the phone with the mom, it affects my points.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Ice Box</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>As a user, when I reach a certain score, I have more options for gaining points.</li>
				<li>As a user, when I win a level, I move onto another level.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Style:</h2>
			<p>After starting to work on the game, it was hard to decide how to style it. While I am capable of using tools such as Photoshop, I am not a graphic designer and knew I had to set a limit for how much time I would work on the actual look of the app in order to have my MVP within four days.</p>

			<div class="caption">The background I made for the app.</div>
			<p>I took advantage of Geocities-type website styling to make the app feel more fun--and to make it more fun to work on. When I hit a wall in my Javascript, I'd spend some time on the CSS, and it would help me to keep going.</p>
			<img src="images/bannerad01.png" alt="fake banner ad">
			<div class="caption">Based on 90s banner ads, on the app it links to my github repo</div>
			<p>While it might be a little silly, this CSS ended up being harder than making a more modern looking app and is something that adds wonderfully to the atmosphere of the game.</p>

			<h2>Sample Code</h2>
			<p>The following code is part of my GameView. It is the main Game Loop for my game, which goes through the various necessary functions every time a user makes a choice.</p>
